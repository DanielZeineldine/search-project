    title: "CSS-in-JS: Styling in Modern JavaScript Applications",
    content:
      "CSS-in-JS is a styling approach where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files. Popular libraries include Styled-components, Emotion, and JSS. This approach allows for scoped styles, dynamic styling based on props or state, and elimination of class name conflicts. CSS-in-JS solutions typically generate unique class names for components, ensuring style encapsulation. The approach has gained popularity in component-based frameworks like React and Vue. Critics argue that it breaks the separation of concerns principle and can lead to larger bundle sizes. However, proponents highlight benefits like dead code elimination, better developer experience, and the ability to use JavaScript's full power for styling logic. The choice between CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules, or traditional CSS often depends on team preferences and project requirements.",
